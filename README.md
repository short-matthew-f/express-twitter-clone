# Express-Mongo-Twitter

We're going to build a twitter clone in Express and Mongo.  It won't be stylish, but it will have most of the trimmings of a full app, otherwise.

## Phase 1

First we need to setup our overall environment, including installing packages:
- express
- body-parser
- method-override
- ejs
- express-ejs-layouts
And creating directories for ejs templates, and the public views.
